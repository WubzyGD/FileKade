# FileKade

**Welcome to FileKade's official repository!**

This project is mainly just me learning the ropes of electron, but I'm fairly well-versed in HTML/CSS/JS, and things are coming along quite well!

> For **downloads**, have a look at [releases](https://github.com/WubzyGD/FileKade/releases). ([git.wubzy.xyz](https://git.wubzy.xyz/Wubzy/FileKade/releases)), or build from source. Just `git clone`, `npm i` and `npm i -g electron`, then `npm start`

## Features

FileKade has *loads* of fun features that most file explorers don't have. Well, it will, at least.

### Current

- The basics. You can explore files :p
- Sports a highly aesthetic background and theme
- Fun, clean animations and moving gradients
- Intuitive and speedy keybinds
- Clean code that works with you and your changes both in and out of the app

_yeah listen it's not super powerful yet \*cough* we **are** in alpha_ 

### Planned

- A sidebar to quickly access your most-used folders
  - Possibly folders to really organize your favorite places?
  - Maybe some user-set icons, too
- Loads of settings
  - Custom backgrounds
  - Custom colors
- In-app file-viewers and maybe even editors
- Integration with apps like Windows terminal and Visual Studio Code

## Contribution

Want to contribute to FileKade? **Awesome!**

Fork and make a PR. I'm not going to burst a blood vessel over formatters or anything like that; just a hobbyist making something fun, so if you have something you want to add, don't be shy at all to add it!

## Acknowledgements/Other

*Notice*: FileKade is a project currently in its **Alpha** state. Everything is temporary and nothing is bug-free (theoretically). Certainly don't rely on this file explorer as your main driver or anything. Linux support is currently minimal at best, and MacOS is entirely untested and likely to break.

This project was heavily inspired by [Xplorer](https://github.com/kimlimjustin/xplorer). Its current file icons were taken from that app, because again, this project is not intended to be public at the current moment. In other words, you're free to use FileKade, but don't shoot me for the icons :3

I'd also like to thank [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com) for their open source license. I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) religiously, and it's been an immense help and a wonderful IDE that I'm happy to call my main JS/HTML IDE.
